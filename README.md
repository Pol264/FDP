# Applicabiliy domain for protein language models
This repository contains the code and datasets developed for my Bachelor’s Thesis, completed within the Bachelor’s Degree in Bioinformatics (BDBI) at ESCI-UPF in Barcelona, in collaboration with Nostrum Biodiscovery.


# Project Overview
This work explores the applicability domain of ESM2 protein language models (pLM) trained with UniRef dataset and tested with MGnify sequences grouped into homology bins (40–60%, 60–80%, etc.).Our objective is assesing the influence of model size (8M,35M,150M and 650M parameters), dataset redundancy (UniRef50 vs UniRef90) and training time. To evaluate it, different metrics have been used: Cosine similarity, Fréchet ChemNet Distance, Mahalanobis distance, Perplexity score and the autoencoder-based unfamiliarity score.
